<h1 align="center">Rustception - The Rusty Repository</h1>
<h3 align="center">A repository completely dedicated to the word Rust, not to be confused with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust</a>.</h3>

<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Majority of the things inside of the universe do not have a clear reason for their existence. Apply that fact to this repository.</p>

<h4>How can I contribute to the Rustception?</h4>
<p>Simple, just create a file of any programming language of your choice titled "rust" in the <a href="https://github.com/devrusty/Rustception/tree/main/src">src</a> folder and display the word "Rust" to the console in whatever way you'd like.</p>
